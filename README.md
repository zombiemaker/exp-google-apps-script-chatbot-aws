## (Optional) Hosting Google Chat Avatar Icon File Using GitHub Pages

If you want to customize the avatar icon that Google Chat uses for your chatbot and you need a place to host the icon file, you can use GitHub Pages.  If you store your git repo for this project in GitHub, this gives you the added convenience of storing the icon file with your source code.  To find a free icon, simply use Google Search with the search phrase "free bot icon".  Download the icon and add to your project repo.

1. Create a repo for your project on GitHub
1. Push your code to the repo with the icon file
1. Navigate to the Settings page for the repository
1. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
1. Select the source for your GitHub Pages for th project
1. Select "Save
1. Select "Choose a theme"
1. Select a theme
1. Use a web browser to navigate to your GitHub Pages for the project.  The URL follows the pattern: https://<GitHub username>.github.io/<repo name>
1. The URL to the icon file is: https://<GitHub username>.github.io/<repo name>/<path to icon file>
1. Use that URL when you configure Google Chat Hangouts API setting in you GCP project

## Create A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project

1. Read https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects
1. Navigate in a web browser to GCP Resource Manager - https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager

1. NOTE: There seems to be a bug in GCP here where the new project does not appear on the webpage.  Simply refresh the webpage.

## (NOT NEEDED) Create A Service Account On Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

1. Navigate in a web browser to GCP Console - https://console.developers.google.com/

1. When you use a bot for the first time, you may get a response with a link displayed as "Configure"
1. Select "Configure" and allow the bot to have the authorizations it needs

## Test ChatBot In Google Chat

1. Once added, test out the bot commands such as:
    1. "/aws help"

    1. "/aws vpc"
